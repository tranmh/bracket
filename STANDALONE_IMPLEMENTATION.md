# Standalone Implementation Guide

This document describes how to implement the standalone desktop version of Bracket Tournament System.

## Quick Start

1. **Run setup script:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup-standalone.ps1
   ```

2. **Make the minimal database change:**
   In `backend/bracket/database.py`, find the line with `DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("PG_DSN", ...)` and replace with the code from Artifact 1.

3. **Copy all new files from the artifacts to your project**

4. **Build the application:**
   ```powershell
   .\build-standalone.ps1
   ```

5. **Find your executable in `dist-standalone/`**

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files (1 file)
- `backend/bracket/database.py` - Add SQLite support with environment variable

### New Files (15 files)
- Build system: 6 files in `standalone/build/`
- Electron app: 4 files in `standalone/electron/`
- Configuration: 2 files in `standalone/configs/`
- Scripts: 3 files for building and setup

## Testing

The build process includes automatic testing:
- Backend executable functionality
- API endpoint responsiveness
- Database connectivity

## Distribution

The final output is a single `.exe` file that can be distributed to users. No installation required - just double-click to run.

## Community Contribution

This implementation is designed to be contributed back to the main project:
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Additive features only
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation

See the community contribution roadmap for integration strategy.
